          <h3><i>Why do you like Incubus?</i></h3>
	  <p>
	  To be honest, I didn't like Incubus at first.  The first song I heard from them was a song called "echo".  I was a freshman in high school
          and told the guy who was listening to it that it sounded like crap.  After hearing other songs on the radio, such as one of
          their more popular songs "drive", I started to like them.  Ironically, I now count "echo" among my favorites by them.
          </p>
	  <p>
	  I consider Incubus to be one of the most musically talented bands out there.  I have listened to all of their
	  albums, and the first thing that struck me was how diverse their music is.  Surprisingly, they can pull this diversity off.
	  They have some very slow songs, such as echo or aqueous transmission, which could be considered soothing or calming.  On the
	  other hand, they have some 'hard' songs, which, depending on your mood, are very good as well.  I will say that every album
	  shows a different side of their musical talent.  Every album has an entirely different feel than any other one, but yet still
	  has that unique incubus tone.
          <h3><i>Do you still listen to incubus?</i></h3>
	  <p>
	  I do not listen to incubus that much anymore, sadly.  I have my periods of binge listening to them, though.  After making
	  this webpage, I can feel another binge listening period creeping on, though :P.
	  </p>
	  <h3><i>What is your favorite incubus album?</i></h3>
	  <p>
	  It is pretty hard to answer this question.  I would have to say my favorite is morning view.  It was also my first album that
	  I ever purchased by them.  If you haven't listened through this album at least once, you haven't lived life, or something.
